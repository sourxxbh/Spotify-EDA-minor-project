Spotify User Churn Analysis: A Shocking Investigation
Or, "Why Are People Ghosting Us? An In-Depth Look at Things We Already Knew."
üìù Overview
Welcome to a data science project that dares to ask the tough questions. In an era of unprecedented technological advancement, we have tackled one of the most baffling mysteries of our time: why do users leave Spotify? Is it the overwhelming selection of music? The perfectly curated playlists? Or could it be... something else entirely?
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that documents our harrowing journey into a dataset of 8,000 Spotify users. We used the arcane arts of Python and data visualization to uncover a truth so profound, so earth-shattering, that it will surely change the face of digital media forever. (Spoiler alert: It's the ads.)
üìä The "Data"
Our investigation is based on a top-secret dossier, spotify_churn_dataset.csv, which contains highly sensitive information about our subjects. The data is so clean and perfect, with absolutely no missing values, that it's either the work of a data wizard or it's as real as my excuse for not going to the gym.
The file contains the following columns, each a clue in our grand mystery:
user_id: The subject's secret agent number.
gender: The user's preferred pronouns, including "Other," for those who identify as a vibe.
age: How many trips around the sun they've taken, presumably while listening to angsty music.
country: Their geographic location, which surprisingly has little to do with their taste in sea shanties.
subscription_type: Are they a freeloader or a paying customer? The eternal question.
listening_time: How many hours they've dedicated to ignoring their responsibilities.
songs_played_per_day: A measure of their commitment issues with music.
skip_rate: How often they say "Next!" to a song, like a ruthless reality show judge.
device_type: Their weapon of choice for musical consumption.
ads_listened_per_week: The number of times their zen was shattered by a cheerful car insurance ad.
offline_listening: A binary indicator of whether they've paid to escape the ad-pocalypse.
is_churned: The ultimate betrayal. 1 for "they left us," 0 for "they're still here... for now."
üî¨ Our Groundbreaking "Findings"
After hours of painstaking analysis, we have arrived at a conclusion that will surely be published in all the top scientific journals. The primary reason people are leaving Spotify is... they don't like ads.
I know, I was shocked too. It seems that interrupting a user's immersion in a heart-wrenching ballad with a loud, upbeat advertisement for a product they'll never buy is not, in fact, a good user retention strategy.
Other "Startling" Insights:
Users who have premium subscriptions (and thus can listen offline) listen to significantly fewer ads. It's almost as if they paid to not listen to ads. Wild.
There's a weak correlation between listening time and churning. It seems the breakup isn't about how much time they spent with Spotify, but the quality of that time (i.e., ad-free time).
üöÄ How to Replicate This Nobel-Worthy Research
Want to embark on this thrilling adventure yourself? It's simple:
Clone this repository (or just download the notebook, let's not get carried away).
Make sure you have all the necessary spy gadgets (see Dependencies below). A typo in the pip install command is optional but adds to the authenticity of the experience.
Open Spotify EDA minor project.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.
Run the cells in order.
Prepare to have your mind blown by the obvious.
